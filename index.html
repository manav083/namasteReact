        <!-- With HTML -->
        <!-- <h1>Hello World!</h1> -->
        <h1>Manav is here!</h1>

            root.render function no many how many tags are there -->

    <h1>Hello Below the root</h1>
    <!-- this tag will work because react only works
    in the root tag. So, we can also use react in small 
    part of our app like header, footer etc. -->

    <!-- Thats why react is library which can be work independently
    anywhere not a framework because framework requires to build an app
    from scratch and react just provide 
    tools for building apps can be used small parts of our app -->

    <!-- Order of these script tag should be in order else it will throw
     an ERROR on YOUR FACE -->



    <!-- With Javascript -->
    <!-- <script>
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        heading.innerHTML = "Hello World! from Javascript";

        const root = document.getElementById("root");

    <!-- What is crossorigin? -->
    <!-- It means that the browser can load resources from another domain -->
    <!-- This is used to prevent CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) -->
    <!-- CORS is used to prevent malicious scripts from accessing your data -->
    
    <!-- What is CDN? -->
    <!-- CDN is a Content Delivery Network -->
    <!-- CDNs deliver static files faster than loading them from server -->
    <!-- CDNs are used to deliver static files like CSS, JS, Images -->
    <!-- They have multiple servers around the world so when user request
    <!-- any file then he/she gets response from nearest server -->
    <!-- CDN is a network of servers distributed globally -->
    <!-- CDN is used to deliver content to the user faster -->
    <!-- When you include any file or resource using cdn then first time -->
    <!-- The browser has to download that file but next time when same file -->
    <!-- Is requested again then instead of downloading it again -->
    <!-- The browser will use the cached version -->
    <!-- That's why it loads files faster -->
