-> "React.createElement" is a core functionality of react but to
create root element i.e. to put the code in browser we need
to use "ReactDOM.createRoot()".

-> "React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React!") "
empty object in above line of code is used to give attributes
to the element like "id", "class" etc....

-> "React.createElement()" : 
        It does not create a element 
        but a javascript object which also has props.

-> "render() method" : It takes the object created by createElement method and converts it in html tag.
