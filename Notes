-> "React.createElement" is a core functionality of react but to
create root element i.e. to put the code in browser we need
to use "ReactDOM.createRoot()".

-> "React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React!") "
empty object in above line of code is used to give attributes
to the element like "id", "class" etc....

-> "React.createElement()" : 
        It does not create a element 
        but a javascript object which also has props.

-> "render() method" : It takes the object created by createElement method and converts it in html tag.


-> "Process for configuring git repo --------------"
        git init
        git add README.md
        change branch name to git branch -M main or <branchname>
        git commit 
        git remote add origin "repo url"
        git push origin main or <branchname>

-> "We need to process our code i.e. bundle it, compress it
optimise it to push it io production that's why me make a build
or bundle to push it to production."

-> "CRA" - It provides us a scaffold of react app which is already
        production ready.
        <------------- It uses webpack and babel as bundler behind the scenes. ------------->

-> "Make our app faster" - React make our app fast but there are lots of other packages that are
        needed to make our app faster and scalable.

-> "NPM" - Npm manages packages but remember it does not stand for "Node Package Manager".
        It is a standard repo for all the packages. It is one of biggest repo for packages, libraries
        and it manages our packages.

-> "Create React App without CRA or vite but from scratch":
        -- npm init (after this we will get new file called "package.json")
                // "package.json" - basically configuration of npm that we need in our project.
                // "Dependencies or dev-dependencies": Packages on which our project depends on exist in "package.json".
        -- first package needs to be installed is a "Bundler": Our whole code needs to be bundled together, minified, cleaned 
                before pushing to the production like webpack, parcel and vite.
                <-------- We will be using parcel as "bundler" in this app ------------>
                Command used will be "npm install -D parcel"
        <------------- Dependencies and Dev-Dependencies -------------->
                Dev dependencies are those which are used in "development" phase 
                and Dependencies are those which are used in both "development and production" phase.
