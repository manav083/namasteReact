# Code Moduler:

    - If we need to use a piece of code n times then make it a component. Basically, make the code moduler.

# props or properties

    - If we want to send the data dynamically to a component then we can use props.
    - Because component is simply a function therfore props are just simple arguments to a function.

# Destructuring on the fly

    - React wrap all the props as an object.
    - while receiving the props in a component we can destructure the props. This is called "Desturcture on the fly"
