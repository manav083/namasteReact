# UI layer and data layer work together means updating the DOM efficiently, DOM manipulation.
    - All the frameworks and libraries are trying to do so means if a list or something change then DOM updated 
        automatically.
    - In react we can do this by making a variable as a state. Whenever a state changes then react re-render the DOM automatically without reloading the whole page.
    - React always keep UI layer and Data layer in sync.
    - React makes DOM operations superfast.

# React-Hooks:
    - A hook is a normal javascript utility function given by react which has some pre-defined role.

# Two most important Hooks:
    - useState() - It is used to generate state variables in react.
    - useEffect()

# Whenever a state variable changes react re-render our component (in layman's term refreshes our component or update of UI whenever state changes);
