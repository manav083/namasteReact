# What is HOC?
    - It is a javascript function which takes a component as input 
    and returns a new enhanced component with some new modifications and changes.

# Controlled & Uncontrolled Components
    - The child component whose actions are controlled by parent component are controlled
    and whose actions are not controlled by parent component are called uncontrolled.

# Lifting the state Up
    - Updating the parent state from child component, read more about this from react docs....

# Props Drilling
    - Passing props from one parent to child and that child to its child and so on is called props 
    drilling. Passing props is necessary and important but should avoid props drilling if there are many levels 
    of child and we want to pass from top to bottom. Can be accomplished using "Context API". Read more from docs...
