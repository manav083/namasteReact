What is "cdn"? Why do we use it?

    CDN is a Content Delivery Network
    CDNs deliver static files faster than loading them from server
    CDNs are used to deliver static files like CSS, JS, Images
    They have multiple servers around the world so when user request
    any file then he/she gets response from nearest server
    CDN is a network of servers distributed globally
    CDN is used to deliver content to the user faster
    When you include any file or resource using cdn then first time
    The browser has to download that file but next time when same file
    Is requested again then instead of downloading it again
    The browser will use the cached version
    That's why it loads files faster
